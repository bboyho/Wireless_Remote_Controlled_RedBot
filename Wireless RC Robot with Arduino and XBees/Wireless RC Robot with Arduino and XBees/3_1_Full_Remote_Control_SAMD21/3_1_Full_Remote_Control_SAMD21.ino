   This is example code for the Wireless Joystick with SAMD21. Any character entered through the
   Serial Monitor or when a condition statement is satisfied will be sent to the hardware UART pins.
   Assuming that you have a pair of XBees Series 1 modules (or Series 3 modules configured with 802.15.4 protocol) on the
   same channel, a character will be transmitted wirelessly between the XBees. The receiving
   XBee will then pass the character to the an ATmega328P microcontroller to move the robot forward.

   Pressing down on D2 (if you soldered the joystick on the right or a button) will check
   the joystick on the left. A character will be transmitted when moving the joystick.
   
       up = forward
       right = forward turn right
       down = reverse
       left = forward turn left
       center = coast

   When D2 is not being pressed, a character will be sent to stop the motors.

   The RedBot will need to be programmed to read those values.

   Note: You may need to connect A5 to the XBee Series 3's reset pin on the Wireless Joystick
   for certain XBee Series 3 modules. For more details, check out the xbee3_RESET() function.
